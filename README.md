Raisin Class Prediction Model Evaluation

The logistic regression model was evaluated using the GridSearchCV technique to fine-tune its hyperparameters and enhance its performance. The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on both the training and test sets to assess its effectiveness in classifying raisin grains into the Kecimen and Besni varieties.

The evaluation results on the test set are as follows:

Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 0.87, indicating that 87% of the predictions were correct.
Precision: The precision score of 0.89 demonstrates the model's ability to accurately classify raisin grains, minimizing false positive predictions.
Recall: The recall score of 0.84 indicates the model's effectiveness in capturing a high proportion of true positive predictions, minimizing false negative predictions.
F1-score: The F1-score of 0.86 provides a balanced measure of the model's precision and recall, reflecting its overall performance.
The model's performance on the training set is as follows:

Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 0.87 on the training set, indicating consistent performance across different data.
Precision: The precision score of 0.88 demonstrates the model's ability to accurately classify raisin grains in the training set.
Recall: The recall score of 0.85 indicates the model's effectiveness in capturing a high proportion of true positive predictions in the training set.
F1-score: The F1-score of 0.86 reflects the harmonized performance of the model in terms of precision and recall on the training set.
These results highlight the model's ability to effectively classify raisin grains into the Kecimen and Besni varieties. The high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score indicate its robustness and reliability. However, it is important to consider further validation and testing on additional datasets to ensure the model's generalizability.
